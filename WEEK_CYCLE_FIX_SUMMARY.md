# 🔧 **WEEK CYCLE CALCULATION FIX**

## 🎯 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The kitchen menu was showing blank even though the cook had created meals because of **inconsistent week cycle calculations** between the cook and kitchen systems.

### **❌ BEFORE (Inconsistent):**

**Cook System:**
```php
$weekOfMonth = now()->weekOfMonth;
$weekCycle = ($weekOfMonth % 2 === 1) ? 1 : 2;
// Week 1 = 1, Week 2 = 2, Week 3 = 1, Week 4 = 2
```

**Kitchen System:**
```php
$weekCycle = (now()->weekOfMonth % 2) + 1;
// Week 1 = 2, Week 2 = 1, Week 3 = 2, Week 4 = 1
```

**Kitchen PreOrder System:**
```php
$weekOfMonth = (int) date('W', strtotime($date)) - (int) date('W', strtotime(date('Y-m-01', strtotime($date)))) + 1;
$weekCycle = ($weekOfMonth % 2) == 0 ? 2 : 1;
// Different calculation entirely!
```

### **✅ AFTER (Consistent):**

**All Systems Now Use:**
```php
$weekOfMonth = now()->weekOfMonth;
$weekCycle = ($weekOfMonth % 2 === 1) ? 1 : 2;
```

**Week Cycle Logic:**
- **Week 1 of month** → **Week Cycle 1**
- **Week 2 of month** → **Week Cycle 2** 
- **Week 3 of month** → **Week Cycle 1**
- **Week 4 of month** → **Week Cycle 2**

## ✅ **FILES FIXED**

### **1. Kitchen MenuController**
- **File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Kitchen/MenuController.php`
- **Fixed:** Week cycle calculation in `index()` method
- **Added:** Debug logging to track meal loading

### **2. Kitchen PreOrderController**
- **File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Kitchen/PreOrderController.php`
- **Fixed:** Week cycle calculation in `getAvailableMeals()` method
- **Fixed:** Week cycle calculation in `debugMeals()` method
- **Added:** Enhanced debugging and logging

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING ADDED**

### **Kitchen Menu Loading:**
```php
\Log::info('🍽️ Kitchen loading menu', [
    'today' => $today,
    'day_of_week' => $dayOfWeek,
    'week_cycle' => $weekCycle,
    'week_of_month' => $weekOfMonth
]);
```

### **Available Meals Search:**
```php
\Log::info('🔍 Kitchen searching for available meals', [
    'requested_date' => $date,
    'requested_meal_type' => $mealType,
    'calculated_day_of_week' => $dayOfWeek,
    'calculated_week_cycle' => $weekCycle
]);
```

## 🚀 **TESTING STEPS**

### **Step 1: Clear Caches**
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

### **Step 2: Test Kitchen Menu**
1. **Login as Kitchen user**
2. **Go to:** `/kitchen/daily-menu`
3. **Check:** Should now show cook's meals for today

### **Step 3: Test Kitchen Polling**
1. **Go to:** `/kitchen/pre-orders`
2. **Select today's date and meal type**
3. **Check:** Cook's meals should appear in dropdown

### **Step 4: Debug Endpoints**
- **Kitchen Debug:** `/kitchen/pre-orders/debug-meals`
- **Check logs:** `storage/logs/laravel.log`

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **Kitchen Daily Menu:**
- ✅ Shows cook's meals for current day
- ✅ Displays meal names and ingredients
- ✅ Shows preparation status

### **Kitchen Pre-Orders:**
- ✅ Available meals dropdown populated
- ✅ Can create polls using cook's meals
- ✅ Polls work with correct meal data

### **Week Cycle Consistency:**
- ✅ Cook creates meal for Week 1 Monday
- ✅ Kitchen sees meal for Week 1 Monday
- ✅ Students see meal for Week 1 Monday
- ✅ All systems synchronized

## 🎯 **VERIFICATION**

**To verify the fix is working:**

1. **Check Current Week Cycle:**
   ```
   Today: January 16, 2025
   Week of Month: 3
   Week Cycle: 1 (because 3 % 2 === 1)
   ```

2. **Cook Creates Meal:**
   - Day: Thursday
   - Week Cycle: 1
   - Meal Type: Lunch
   - Name: "Chicken Sandwich"

3. **Kitchen Should See:**
   - Same meal on Thursday, Week 1, Lunch
   - Available in daily menu
   - Available for polling

## 🎉 **FINAL RESULT**

**The kitchen menu and polling system should now work perfectly!**

- ✅ **Kitchen Daily Menu** shows cook's meals
- ✅ **Kitchen Pre-Orders** can create polls
- ✅ **Week cycles** are consistent across all systems
- ✅ **Real-time synchronization** between cook and kitchen

**All systems now use the same week cycle calculation, ensuring perfect synchronization between cook menu planning and kitchen operations!** 🚀
